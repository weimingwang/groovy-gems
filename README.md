# Groovy Gems

My notes of different scenarios Groovy can come in handy.

Over the years, the more I used it, the more I'm fond of it. Groovy is such a powerful and flexible tool and combining it with other framework and tools, one can write extremely concise and elegant code. That's why I'm keeping a list of commonly used code to demonstrate the power of Groovy and also remind me when I forget the details.
